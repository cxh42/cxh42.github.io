I am Xinghao Chen. I received my M.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering (MSEE) from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) in December 2025.  

I am currently a paid on-site Research Assistant at Texas A&M University, working with [Dr. Zhengzhong Tu](https://vztu.github.io/) in the [TACO Research Group](https://taco-group.github.io/).

My research interests focus on computer vision and generative AI. I have worked on projects involving 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), diffusion models, LLM agents, image segmentation, and reinforcement learning.

<span style="color: #cc3333;"><strong>I am actively looking for PhD positions starting Fall 2026 (and possible Spring 2027)! If you are interested in working together or have potential PhD opportunities, please feel free to contact me. [Edu email](mailto:cxh42@uw.edu)</strong></span>
