I am a first-year M.S. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/).

My research interest focuses on Computer Vision and Generative AI, I have worked on topics like 3DGS, Diffusion models, LLM fine-tuning, Image Segmentation, etc.

Prior to my M.S., I completed my undergraduate degree in Automation at the [Henan University](https://iao.henu.edu.cn/yw/Home.htm).

I am preparing for PhD application in Spring & Fall 2026, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Open for research opportunities. Feel free to contact me via [email](xhc42@outlook.com).
