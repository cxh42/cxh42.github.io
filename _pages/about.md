I am Xingahao Chen, a master's student at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). 

My research interests focus on computer vision and generative AI, and I have worked on projects involving 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), diffusion models, LLM agents, image segmentation, and reinforcement learning.

<span style="color: #cc3333;"><strong>I am actively looking for PhD positions (Spring & Fall 2026)! If you are interested in working together or have potential PhD opportunities, please feel free to contact me.</strong></span>
