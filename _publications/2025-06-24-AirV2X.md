title: "AirV2X: Unified Air-Ground Vehicle-to-Everything Collaboration"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2025-06-24-AirV2X
excerpt: 'While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of "uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side Units (RSUs). Drones offer unique advantages over ground-based perception: complementary birds-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules, and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban, suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions. The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized evaluation of Vehicle-to-Drone (V2D) algorithms, addressing a critical gap in the rapidly expanding field of aerial-assisted autonomous driving systems. The dataset and development kits are open-sourced at this https [URL](https://github.com/taco-group/AirV2X-Perception).'

While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of "uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side Units (RSUs). Drones offer unique advantages over ground-based perception: complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules, and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban, suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions. The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized evaluation of Vehicle-to-Drone (V2D) algorithms, addressing a critical gap in the rapidly expanding field of aerial-assisted autonomous driving systems.
